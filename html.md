### Installing Atom

We're going to use Atom. Atom is a free open source text/file editor for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows.

Go to [atom.io](https://atom.io/) and hit the download button or download it from [github releases](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.57.0).

Unzip the file that downloaded and set up atom. Now Launch it
